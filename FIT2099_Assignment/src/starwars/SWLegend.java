/**
 * This class represents "legends" - major characters - in the Star Wars universe.  
 * They use a variation of the Singleton
 * pattern to ensure that only ONE of each legend can exist.
 * 
 * Subclasses are intended to contain a static instance which represents the one
 * and only instance of the subclass.  
 * 
 * Subclasses should implement their own "getLegendClass" method that returns 
 * the single instance. There is no abstract method for this to avoid an 
 * unnecessary downcast.
 * 
 * To prevent SWLegends acting until intended, this abstract class implements
 * an API for activating them when getInstance is called.
 * 
 * Rather than implement act() like regular SWActors, Legends should implement
 * legendAct().
